I'm using this repo to test code changes to support a colleague's experiment.  

# Room Assignment Problem

This is an experiment powered by

[tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2YhEZey_58&list=PLPQelvUwyVgiawBDk3Sp74QMfL8RPgORW&index=1)).
Through this experiment we attempt to answer the question: **How does team
composition affect team performance?**
